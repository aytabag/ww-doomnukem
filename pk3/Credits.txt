-- DoomNukem drew the vast majority of the graphics for this mod. Without him,
   this project would not even be a thing.
-- As much as I hesitate to mention him, Sgt. Mark IV at least inspired
   DoomNukem to draw better graphics for what was originally a set of Brutal Doom
   weapon replacements. Fortunately, those efforts have gone towards something
   a bit more ambitious.
-- Kate for coding advice.
-- Ed the Bat for all sorts of little changes.
-- Voxelbro did the voxel graphics and definitions for them; this is based on
   Accessories to Voxel 2.0.
-- The brightmaps, bullet puffs, and tons of the special graphical effects
   were provided kindly by Pillowblaster. The bullet casings and explosions, too.
-- Except for the spark effects on the Cacos, and the Imp fireballs; those are SolarSnowfall's.
-- The rocket ammo box was borrowed from The Astonishing Jessica Jhett mod by
   WORrior and modified by me (wildweasel).
   
The enemy sprites come from the following Realm667 Bestiary monsters:
-- Sawedoff Zombie by Xim
-- Z-Sec by Captain Toenail and Ghastly_Dragon
-- Zombie Henchman by CthulhuCultist
-- Blood Demon by Neoworm, Vader, and Sandypaper.
-- Blood Fiend by Eriance and Sandypaper.
-- Bruiser Demon by Vader, Ghastly_Dragon, Keksdose, Sandypaper, and Marty Kirra (recoloring).
-- Cacolich by Vader and Ghastly_Dragon.
-- Ethereal Soul by Neoworm, Vader, Ghastly_Dragon, and Sandypaper
-- Hellstorm Archon by Eriance and Ghastly_Dragon
-- Imp Variants by Damien Daurio, ItsNatureToDie, and Vader
-- Tortured Soul by Assmaster
-- Zombie Plasma Tank by 3DRealms, Xim and Enjay
-- Vore by Nmn, Vader, and Ghastly_Dragon
-- Deadabus by Vegeta, Aerial, Tormentor667

-- The (current) blood sprites came from a pack of replacement blood decals for Half-Life.
   I've forgotten the author of them.
