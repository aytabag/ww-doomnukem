REVOFIRE is a mixture of sounds from Action Half-Life and Killing Floor IJC Weapon Pack.

RICOCHET comes from an unknown source, but I didn't end up using it in the mod anyway.

REVOOPEN, CLS, and LOAD are from a mixture of sources from Action Half-Life,
Day of Defeat, Crimsonland, and Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault.
